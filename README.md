# Simple Neural Network

Somewhat refactored and simplified version of Joel Grus' awesome live coding
madness:

I don't fancy type hints: they just doesn't solve a problem I'm having, and
lead to tons of empty boiler plate classes that exist just to satisfy all the
type hints. If I wanted that, I'd just use C++ or Java, which are so much
better at this whole typing business.
